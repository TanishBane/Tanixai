## 2. DETAILED CHRONOLOGICAL ACTIONS LOG

### Entry 001 — 2026-11-01 01:04:45
- **Action:** Environment inspection. Verified Node.js v24.20.0, npm v11.19.0, pnpm v12.15.0, git v2.56.0.
- **Git Baseline:** Initialized Git repository, committed legacy Tanix AI codebase with engineering audit to `main` (commit `1c60362`), and checked out `feature/radiance-platform-transformation`.
- **Knowledge Base Setup:** Created Phase 0 reconnaissance documents:
  - `.antigravity/RADIANCE_SKILL_INVENTORY.md`
  - `.antigravity/RADIANCE_MCP_INVENTORY.md`
  - `.antigravity/RADIANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `.antigravity/RADIANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`

### Entry 002 — 2026-11-01 01:09:12
- **Action:** Safely moved 9 legacy root files to `legacy/` (`legacy/app.js`, `legacy/bg3d.js`, `legacy/chat.js`, `legacy/index.html`, `legacy/manifest.json`, `legacy/style.css`, `legacy/sw.js`, `legacy/vercel.json`, `legacy/api/chat.js`).
- **Dependencies Setup:** Configured `package.json` for Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide icons, Three.js, Vercel AI SDK, Supabase JS, Zod, Vitest. Installed via `pnpm.cmd install` and approved native builds (`esbuild`, `unrs-resolver`).

### Entry 003 — 2026-11-01 01:12:30
- **Action:** Implemented core library and utility layers:
  - `src/lib/types/chat.ts`, `src/lib/types/theme.ts`: Strict types for models, messages, attachments, tones, themes.
  - `src/lib/utils/format.ts`: Robust markdown lexer with code block masking (fixing BUG-02 double-escaping).
  - `src/lib/utils/storage.ts`: `safeLocalStorage` preventing `QuotaExceededError` (fixing BUG-04).
  - `src/lib/ai/models.ts`, `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts`, `src/lib/ai/circuit-breaker.ts`, `src/lib/ai/followups.ts`: Multi-provider setup, circuit breaker, follow-ups (fixing BUG-01).
  - `src/lib/security/rate-limiter.ts`, `src/lib/security/sanitize.ts`: Token-bucket rate limiting and input sanitization (fixing SEC-01, SEC-03).
  - `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`, `src/app/api/image/route.ts`, `src/app/api/health/route.ts`: API route handlers.
  - `supabase/migrations/20261101_001_initial_schema.sql`: Full Supabase PostgreSQL schema with RLS.

### Entry 004 — 2026-11-01 01:15:10
- **Action:** Built React component tree and visual design system:
  - Three.js procedural 3D ambient canvas (`ambient-canvas.tsx` & `background-layers.tsx`).
  - Radiance branding gem and splash screen (`logo.tsx` & `intro-splash.tsx`).
  - Chat workspace components: `welcome-card.tsx`, `message-item.tsx`, `chat-composer.tsx`, `follow-up-chips.tsx`.
  - Navigation and drawer components: `topbar.tsx`, `sidebar-dock.tsx`, `history-drawer.tsx`, `settings-drawer.tsx`.
  - Dialogs: `shortcuts-dialog.tsx`, `legacy-import-dialog.tsx`.
  - Application entry points: `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx`.

### Entry 005 — 2026-11-01 01:19:40
- **Action:** Automated verification and quality gates execution:
  - `tsc --noEmit`: Exit code 0 (0 type errors).
  - `next lint`: Exit code 0 (0 warnings, 0 errors).
  - `vitest run`: Exit code 0 (9/9 unit tests passing across format, circuit breaker, and storage).
  - `next build`: Exit code 0 (Compiled 7 static pages and 3 dynamic route handlers).

### 2026-11-15 — Install complete mode-specific AI prompts

- Added the supplied Ask, Plan, and Build prompt documents as versioned static JSON resources under `src/lib/ai/system-prompts/`; source text was compared against each embedded prompt after line-ending normalization.
- Replaced the short mode hints with an exhaustive typed mode registry and a shared resolver. Each request receives only its selected mode prompt, with Ask as the default and invalid values falling back to Ask.
- Kept Radiance identity, selected response language, tone, and subordinate custom instructions in the composed system prompt.
- Tightened chat request validation to reject client-provided `system` messages, so only server-owned prompt configuration can establish system instructions.
- Added unit and API integration coverage for all three modes, prompt routing, Ask fallback, language/tone/custom-instruction preservation, and rejection of client system messages.

Verification: 42 focused unit/integration tests passed; `pnpm.cmd typecheck`, `pnpm.cmd lint`, and `pnpm.cmd build` passed.
- Final production-bundle inspection confirmed that the full mode prompt text is not shipped in browser JavaScript; the settings tone catalog is isolated from server prompt data.
- The full suite reported 596/598 passing tests (65/67 files). The two failures are existing unrelated assertions: the dynamic-theme pool expects 29 entries but has 24, and a settings test expects a stale “Response language” label. The prompt/API focused suites pass.
